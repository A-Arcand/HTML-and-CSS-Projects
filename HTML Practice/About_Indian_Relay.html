		<h1>What is Indian Relay?</h1>
		<main>
			<h3> Indian Relay is North America's First Extreme sport!</h3>
			<p>Indian Relay consists of 3 horses and four team members. One rider, a mugger, a backholder, and a setter. The rider will start on the first horse and make one full lap around a track, then they will run into their team's box and exchange off of their horse and onto another. They will repeat this one more time for a final lap.</p>
